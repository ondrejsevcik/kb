## Some other wisdom

- duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction
  - https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction
- Refactoring = code transformation based on what youâ€™ve learnt from the past
- Over-engineering = code transformation based on the speculation for the future

- Comments should describe things that are not obvious from code
- [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#id3)
  - Explicit is better than implicit.
  - Although practicality beats purity.
  - Errors should never pass silently, unless explicitly silenced.
  - There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
  - If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
  - If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
