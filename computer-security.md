- [TED Talk: Why Privacy Matters](https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters)
  - "If you think you have nothing to hide, send me your email password..."

> if you don't pay for a product you are the product

  - Why password length matter? - 8 vs 12 vs 20 char password

- Make an (encrypted) offline backup
  - No guarantee your `Google/FB/Instagram/...` account will be there tomorrow 
- Keep automatic updates on - most vulnerabilities come from outdated software
- Encrypt your Computer/Phone
  - Having a password on the login screen doesn't mean the data are encrypted
- Email
  - Your ID to the internet -> almost every service pw can be restored through email
  - [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com) - ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­Switzerland, zero-knowledge
  - Google mail - ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸USA, no boundaries
- Messaging apps
  - Signal (preferred)
  - Messenger (records everything, analyzes everything)
  - WhatsApp (analyzes metadata)
  - Telegram (unsure)
  - iMessage (stores backup unencrypted in the cloud)
- Social networks
  - the less you use, the better
  - it may be your friends who leak your data
  - be aware of 3rd party apps

- Less software you use the better
- Lock your computer screen
- Don't connect to open Wifi (hackers can imitate them and your phone will connect automatically)
- Use VPN if necessary (ProtonVPN, NordVPN)
- Phishing - always check domain (use a password manager!)
