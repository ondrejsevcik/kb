# Feedback

1. Don't delay giving feedback
1. Always give it in private (one-on-one)
1. Effectively prepare for one-on-one meetings - write down questions you want to ask.
1. Deliver the bad news - tell them what they want to hear.
1. Avoid shit sandwich - it does not work. People know it and it feels insincere.
1. Ask specific questions - generic questions lead to generic answers.
1. Give concrete examples
1. Get well with receiving difficult feedback - it's the view of the person delivering it.
1. Avoid anonymous feedback - it feels fake and dishonest.
1. Always explain your decisions - no matter if you incorporated received feedback or ignored it.

## Hacks

- When you do X, it makes me feel like Y - feels more genuine.
- Ask for advice rather than feedback - people tend to talk more when they are asked for advice, plus it does not have a bad connotation.
