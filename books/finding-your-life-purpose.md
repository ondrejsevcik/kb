# Finding your life purpose - Mark Manson

- When people say "What should I do with my life?" or "What is my life purpose?" what they're actually asking is: "What can I do with my time that is important?". This is an infinitely better question to ask.
- What pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for?
- What we get out of life is not determined by the good feelings we desire but by what bad feelings we're willing and able to sustain to get us to those good feelings.
- If you find yourself wanting something month after month, year after year, yet nothing happens and you never come any closer to it, then maybe you don't actually want it at all. 

> First, I needed to finish school.<br>
> Then, I needed to make money.<br>
> Then, I needed to find the time.<br>
> Then... and then nothing.

- Who you are is defined by the values you are willing to struggle for. People who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who get in good shape. 
- Our struggles determine our successes.
- Everything sucks, some of the time.
- Passion is the result of an action, not the cause of it.
- None of us know exactly how we feel about an activity until we actually do the activity.

> Discovering one's "purpose" in life essentially boils down to finding those one or two things that are bigger than yourself, and bigger than those around you. It's not about some great achievement, but merely finding a way to spend your limited amount of time well. And to do that you must get off your couch and act.
