# Atomic habits

> Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you're willing to stick with them for years.

# The Fundamentals

- Quality of our lives often depend on quality of our habits.
- 1% improvement every day
  - 0.99^365 = 00.03
  - **1.01^365 = 37.78**
- Slow pace of change unfortunatelly also makes it easy to build a bad habit.
  - Eating unhealty won't affect you today...
- Success is product of daily habits
- We expect progress to be linear, but in reality, it takes years to see a great progress.

## Forget about goals, focus on the system instead

- Goals are about results you want to achieve
- Systems are about the processes that lead to those results
- Focus on system! Everyone has the same goal = be the best in something!
- Goals are good for setting direction, but system are for making progress.

## How your habits shape your identity

- Three layers of behavior change
  - Outcomes - What you get - Losing weight, publishing a book, ...
  - Process - What you do - Implementing a new routine, ...
  - Identity - What you believe - Changing your beliefs, self-image, judgments, ...
- Outcome-based habits vs. Identity-based habits
  - Outcome based - "No, thanks. I'm trying to quit smoking."
  - Identity based - "No thanks. I'm not a smoker."
    - The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.
    - Many people blindly follow the norms attached to their identity
      - I'm bad at ...
      - Progress requires unlearning - expand your identity.
- Who you are is what you do.
  - Decide the type of person you want to be.
  - Prove it to yourself with small wins.

## How to build better habits in 4 simple steps

1. Cue - Make it obvious
2. Craving - Make it attractive
3. Response - Make it easy
4. Reward - Make it satisfying

# The 1st Law - Make it obvious

- Start behavior change with awernes
- Habits scorecard
  - List of things you do every day (Wake up, Check my phone, take a shower, ...) 
  - with `+/-/=` signs to mark good/bad/neutral habits
    - Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be?
- Make as specific plan as possible (time and location)
  - Bad - Write more
  - Good - Every day, after dinner, I will sit in my couch and write for 30 minutes
- Habit stacking - form a new habit based on existing one
  - After I pour my morning cup of coffee, I will meditate for sixty seconds.

## Motivation is overrated

- Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.
- Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it.
  - Think in terms of how you interact with the spaces around you.
- Habits can be easier to change in a new environment.
- Every habit should have a home - "One space, one use"

## Secret to self-control

- You can break a habit, but you're unlikely to forget it.
  - Even if you put extra effort into self-control, you will eventually fail.
- Cut a bad habits off at the source - reduce exposure to the cure that causes it (make it invisible)
  - "if you can't get any work done, leave your phone in another room"

## The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping your Habits

- We don't choose our earliest habits, we imitate them (school, family, ...).
- Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe.
- The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us.
- We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups 
  1. the close (family and friends)
  2. the many (the tribe)
  3. the powerful (those with status and prestige)

# The 3rd Law - Make it Easy

- "The best is enemy of the good"
- Being in motion - you're planning and strategizing and learning
- Being in action - this type of behavior will deliver an outcome
- Focus on taking action, not planning
- "The best way is to always stop when you are going good"
- Commitment devices - choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future

# The 4th Law - Make it satisfying 

- Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating
- The consequences of bad habits are delayed while the rewards are immediate
  - Smoking might kill you in ten years, but it reduces stress now
  - Most people will spend all day chasing quick hits of satisfaction
- Use habit tracker - best way to measure progress
  - Don't break the chain
  - You're focused on progress rather than result
  - Never miss twice - nobody is perfect, but missing twice is what makes difference between winners and loosers
- Habit contract - verbal or written agreement with a friend to keep yourself accountable
  - We care what others think of us. Knowing that someone else is watching is powerful motivator.

# Advanced tactics

- For maximizing your odds, pick a right field of competition. Stick with natural inclination and abilities.
- When you can't win by being better, win by being different.
- Goldilocks Rule
  - Human experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.
  - Playing tenis against baby - boring, too easy. Playing agains Nadal - boring, too hard. Playing with a same skilled friend - fun, fun, fun.
- Mastery requires practice
  - but after a time, practice becomes boring
  - you have to fall in love with boredom, if you only do what's exciting, you will never achieve consistency.
  - The ability to keep going when work isn't exciting is what makes difference.
- Once in a time review your habits
- Happines is simply the absence of desire
- Your actions reveal how badly you want something
