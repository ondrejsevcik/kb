# Atomic habits

> Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you're willing to stick with them for years.

# The Fundamentals

- Quality of our lives often depend on quality of our habits.
- 1% improvement every day
  - 0.99^365 = 00.03
  - **1.01^365 = 37.78**
- Slow pace of change unfortunatelly also makes it easy to build a bad habit.
  - Eating unhealty won't affect you today...
- Success is product of daily habits
- We expect progress to be linear, but in reality, it takes years to see a great progress.

## Forget about goals, focus on the system instead

- Goals are about results you want to achieve
- Systems are about the processes that lead to those results
- Focus on system! Everyone has the same goal = be the best in something!
- Goals are good for setting direction, but system are for making progress.
