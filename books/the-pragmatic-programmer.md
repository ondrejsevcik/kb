# The Pragmatic Programmer (20th Aniversary Edition)

- Care about your software
  - There is no point developing software unless you care about doing it well.
- Think about your work
  - Never run on autopilot, always think critiqualy about what you're doing.
- It's in your hands
  - Try to fix it, or change organization.
  - "You can ChangeYourOrganization or [ChangeYourOrganization](https://wiki.c2.com/?ChangeYourOrganization)."
- Provide options, don't make excuses and take responsibility
  - "I don't know... but I will find out!"
- Fix broken windows!
  - One hack in a code leads to another hack and soon your code will become unmanagable.
- Be a catalyst for change
  - "It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission."
  - When you know something is right, just do it.
- Knowledge is an expiring asset
  - Make learninig a habit
- Prototype to learn
  - Correctness
  - Completness
  - Robustness (error checking)
  - Style
  - and then throw it away (it's prototype!)
- Estimate with multiple scenarios
  - Pessimistic and optimistic estimate
  - "If everthing goes right, it might be a few hours, but more realisticaly about 1 day, and if the weather turns out to be bad, then as much as week."
  - "I will get back to you" - take some time for more precise estimate
