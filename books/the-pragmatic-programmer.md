# The Pragmatic Programmer (20th Aniversary Edition)

- Care about your software
  - There is no point developing software unless you care about doing it well.
- Think about your work
  - Never run on autopilot, always think critiqualy about what you're doing.
- It's in your hands
  - Try to fix it, or change organization.
  - "You can ChangeYourOrganization or [ChangeYourOrganization](https://wiki.c2.com/?ChangeYourOrganization)."
- Provide options, don't make excuses and take responsibility
  - "I don't know... but I will find out!"
- Fix broken windows!
  - One hack in a code leads to another hack and soon your code will become unmanagable.
- Be a catalyst for change
  - "It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission."
  - When you know something is right, just do it.
- Knowledge is an expiring asset
  - Make learninig a habit
- Prototype to learn
  - Correctness
  - Completness
  - Robustness (error checking)
  - Style
  - and then throw it away (it's prototype!)
- Estimate with multiple scenarios
  - Pessimistic and optimistic estimate
  - "If everthing goes right, it might be a few hours, but more realisticaly about 1 day, and if the weather turns out to be bad, then as much as week."
  - "I will get back to you" - take some time for more precise estimate
- Keep knowledge in plain text (could be JSON, HTML, YAML, ...)
  - Can be manipulated and read by every tool/human
- Achieve editor fluency
- Always use version control
- Fix the problem, not the blame
  - doesn't matter whose fault it is, it is your problem
- Keep a daybook
  - a journal of what you worked on
- Perfect software doesn't exist
  - It's better to accept this as a fact rather than wasting time and chasing this impossible dream.
- Design by contract
  - Be strict in what you accept befor you begin and promise as little as possible in return.
- Crash early 
  - the alternative is to work with corrupted data
  - a dead program usually does less damage than corrupted one
- Use assertions to prevent impossible
  - whenever you think "this could never happen" - add an assertion on that
  - Don't use assertions in place of real error handling
  - Testing doesn't find all bugs. Keep assertions also in production code (unless they really are a performance issue)
- Finish what you start
  - Routine that allocates the resource should also free it
- Take small steps - always!
- Avoid fortune telling 
  - don't design code for uncertain future - make your code replaceble or easy to throw away
- Tell, Don't ask
- Don't chain method calls
- Avoid global data
  - If i'ts important enough to be global, wrap it in an API
- Use reactive programming, streams and events to decouple code
- Preffer `|>` pipe style of programming
  - loose coupling, no lingering state, less bugs
- Don't pay inheritance tax
  - alternatives are better - Iterfaces, delegation, mixins, traits
  - Inheritance is rarely the answer
- Configuration as a service
  - Although static configuration is common, configuration as a service is better - can build configuration UI, configuration can change during runtime (no restart needed).
