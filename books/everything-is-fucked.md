# Everything is fucked - Mark Manson

Not the best book I've read. I wouldn't recommend it, but those few ideas that stuck with me, I've noted down below.

---

- The 3 Pillars of Hope
  - Control (feeling that we are in control of our lives)
  - Value (belief in the value of something)
  - Community (being part of a community that has the same values)
- Don’t Try to Get Rid of Pain
  - Pain is part of the human existence
  - It's unhealthy to be always happy - you need some pain to grow

> The quality of our lives is determined by the quality of our character, and the quality of our character is determined by our relationship to our pain

- Change Your Values To Become Better, Not Richer
  - If anything, visualize "how not having a yacht would feel like and how you’re OK with it"
